// Locating a REMOTE (SSH-project) Claude transcript when no live hook event has fed one.
//
// `remoteTranscriptBySession` (src/main) is filled ONLY by hook POSTs, and a tmux session
// outlives the app — so after an app restart an idle remote agent node has no ref at all, and
// the local resolvers then search THIS machine's disk for a session that exists only on the
// host. That is the "Ctrl+M says there is no conversation" case: it healed itself the moment the
// user sent one prompt (the next hook event registered the ref), which is exactly what made it
// look intermittent.
//
// These are pure string builders. `src/main` runs the command over the project's ControlMaster
// and jails the answer with `isSafeRemoteTranscriptPath` before reading it.

 * or the node was created elsewhere), and without the glob those resolve to nothing at all.
