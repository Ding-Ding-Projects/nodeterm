/** Decorations — the cell-level colour overrides a terminal paints UNDER its text. xterm's search

 *
 *  Like the rest of this directory it imports NOTHING from xterm. The terminal's decoration service
 *  is private internals, so `src/renderer/terminal/glyphgrid-attach.ts` wraps it into the
 *  `DecorationReader` below and the feed consumes only that interface — the same injection shape
 *  `atlas` and `theme` already use, and what lets this be unit-tested against a fake. */

/**
 * The overrides a cell's decorations impose, or null.
 *
 * WHY 'top' IS SKIPPED, AND WHAT THAT COSTS. Both of xterm's renderers resolve decorations at CELL
 * level and do it twice in one pass: `bottom` BEFORE the selection is applied, `top` AFTER it — so
 * a top-layer decoration outranks the selection band, not merely the base colours. This engine
 * resolves a cell once, in the feed, with the selection last, and expressing "after the selection"
 * would mean a second override stage.
 *
 * That is a DEVIATION, said plainly rather than dressed up as something xterm cannot do either: a
 * top-layer decoration renders as NOTHING here. It costs nothing today — `registerDecoration` has
 * no caller anywhere in `src/`, and `@xterm/addon-search`, the reason this module exists, registers
 * its matches with no layer at all, which is BOTTOM by xterm's own `options.layer ?? 'bottom'`. If a
 * top-layer decoration is ever shipped, this function is where the second stage has to go.
 *
 * LAST WRITER WINS, per channel, matching the callback order xterm hands out — two decorations on
 * one cell is already ambiguous, and agreeing with the renderer we are replacing is the only
 * defensible answer.
 *
 * THE `empty()` FAST PATH IS NOT AN OPTIMIZATION DETAIL. This runs for every cell of every packed
 * row; on the common canvas nothing is decorated at all, and one boolean per cell is the difference
 * between that costing nothing and costing a call into xterm's service per cell.
