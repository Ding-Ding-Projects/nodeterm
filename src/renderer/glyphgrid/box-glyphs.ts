/**
 * GEOMETRIC glyphs for the box-drawing and block-element ranges.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: the shared rasterizer draws every code point with `fillText`, and a font
 * does not guarantee that its box/block glyphs fill the whole cell. Most monospace faces draw
 * U+2500 ─ a pixel or two short of the advance width, which is invisible in a word processor and
 * catastrophic in a terminal — a horizontal rule made of 60 of them shows 60 hairline GAPS, one at
 * every cell boundary. The block elements are worse: ▀▄█▌▐ and the eighth/quadrant family are
 * expected to tile EXACTLY, and a face whose ink is inset by the tiniest amount turns a piece of
 * block art into a lattice of dark seams.
 *
 * This is exactly why xterm's own renderers ship `CustomGlyphs.ts` (both the canvas addon and the
 * WebglAddon, `customGlyphs: true` by default): for these two ranges they stop trusting the font
 * and DRAW the shapes. We do the same, one step earlier — into the atlas instead of onto the
 * screen — so the geometry is rasterized once per code point and every grid samples it.
 *
 * The module is deliberately PURE: it returns rectangles, and knows nothing about a canvas, a
 * context or the atlas. `raster.ts` fills them; everything here is unit-testable arithmetic.
 *
 * ## The FULL-CELL invariant
 *
 * Every arm and every block edge that reaches a cell boundary is emitted at the EXACT boundary —
 * `x === 0` / `x + w === cellW` — never at a rounded approximation of it. Device cells are
 * fractional in general (xterm's `device.cell.width` is `charWidth * dpr`), so rounding the outer
 * edge of a full-width line to whole pixels is precisely how you re-introduce the gap this module
 * exists to remove. Only INTERIOR edges are snapped to whole device pixels (`snapX`/`snapY`),
 * which is what keeps a 1px line from being smeared across two columns of texels by antialiasing.
 *
 * ## v1 approximations (deliberate, documented)
 *
 * - **Rounded corners are drawn SQUARE.** U+256D–U+2570 (╭╮╯╰) use their sharp counterparts' arm
 *   table. A rect-only op list cannot express an arc; the alternative was to leave them to
 *   `fillText`, which would make a rounded box's corners the only part of the frame with gaps.
 * - **Diagonals fall back to the font.** U+2571–U+2573 (╱╲╳) are not axis-aligned and return
 *   `null`, so `fillText` draws them as before. They do not tile, so the gap problem does not
 *   apply to them.
 * - **Double-line junctions are drawn as rails, not as nested corners.** A double arm is two
 *   parallel light rails; where two double arms meet, each rail stops at the EDGE of the near or
 *   the far perpendicular rail (see `pushDoubleArm` — stopping at the rail's centre line is what
 *   left a 1px hole in every ╔╗╚╝ elbow in the first cut of this module). This is exact for the
 *   corners and the plain crossings, and slightly over-draws the tees (╠╣╦╩ keep the crossing rail
 *   continuous where the real glyph breaks it). Every case connects edge-to-edge, which is the
 *   property that matters.
 * - **Heavy/light is a thickness distinction only** — heavy is exactly twice light, which is what
 *   xterm does too.
 */

/**
 * One axis-aligned, fully OPAQUE fill, in CELL-LOCAL device pixels.
 *
 * There is deliberately no alpha channel. The one family that looked like it wanted one — the
 * shade blocks ░▒▓ — is a dither pattern, not a tint (see `SHADES`), and an alpha field would
 * make it possible to "simplify" them back into flat washes that no longer match the renderer
 * beside them. Everything this module draws is ink or nothing.
 *
 * "Opaque" is about the ALPHA, not about a particular colour: `raster.ts` has already filled the
 * slot with the cell's real BACKGROUND, and it fills these rects in the cell's real FOREGROUND, so a
 * set pixel is fully fg and every other pixel is left as bg — the same two states the `fillText`
 * path produces on a colour-keyed atlas, and the reason this module never touches `globalAlpha`.

 * the geometry above rather than by the font — one copy of the geometry, reached by two names.
 *
 * WHY these are here and not left to `fillText` (device round, 2026-08-04). U+23BF ⎿ is Claude
 * Code's tool-result connector, and in shared mode its horizontal foot rendered as a stub: measured
 * off the two screenshots at the same content and zoom, GPU per terminal drew the foot from x 48 to
 * 75 (28 px, about one cell) while shared drew x 51 to 58 (8 px). The foot was not missing, it was
 * TRUNCATED — the face (or Chromium's fallback for it) draws this glyph's ink wider than the
 * terminal cell, and `raster.ts` clips every font-drawn glyph to the cell so the overflow is
 * discarded. xterm's own `TextureAtlas` never meets this: it measures each glyph's real bounding
 * box and stores/renders it at true size, letting ink overflow into the neighbouring cells, which
 * is why GPU mode shows the whole foot.
 *
 * So this is the same argument the module header makes for U+2500–U+259F, arriving from the other
 * side: line art that a font draws at whatever size it likes does not survive a per-cell atlas.

 * not "simplify" the map away on the grounds that the font can draw these characters; it can, and
 * the cell is what cannot hold the result.

 * would upload, and a list that is twice as long as it needs to be is a bad default.
 *
