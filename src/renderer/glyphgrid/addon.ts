   *
   * DEFERRED, NOT IMMEDIATE, and that is the whole design of this method. A reset fires
   * synchronously from inside a `glyphFor` call — i.e. from the middle of a `packRows` loop, ours
   * or another terminal's. Repacking here would re-enter that loop, and the atlas's own guard would
   * then hand the re-entrant requests the BLANK slot to stop it recursing, so the repack would
   * produce exactly the empty cells it exists to prevent. Instead we ask xterm for a full redraw
   * through the same `onRequestRedraw` mechanism `clear()` and a theme change use: RenderService
   * marks the rows dirty and packs them from its own debounced render pass, outside anybody's loop.
   *
   * WHY THE ENGINE'S UPLOAD ORDERING SURVIVES THIS. The engine uploads the atlas before it uploads
   * rows and both before it draws, and a reset preserves that: it marks the atlas dirty, so the
   * next frame re-uploads the cleared-and-refilled page BEFORE any row of it is drawn. Within that
   * frame, the row whose pack triggered the reset carries fresh slots (its remaining cells
   * allocated into the new page); OTHER rows may still name slots that meant something else in the
   * old page, and they are repainted one frame late — the frame this redraw request schedules. A
   * single frame of possibly-stale glyphs on rows nobody has touched, self-healing, is the accepted
   * cost of resets being rare; the alternative is a synchronous repack inside a pack loop, which is
   * a correctness problem rather than a cosmetic one.
   *
   * AND WHY A TERMINAL THAT IS OFF-SCREEN AT RESET TIME STILL HEALS — the mechanism the correctness
   * above quietly rests on. A redraw request for a grid nobody can see does not evaporate at either
   * end: xterm's RenderService answers `refreshRows` on a PAUSED terminal (its intersection observer
   * saw it leave the viewport) by setting `_needsFullRefresh` and flushing that full refresh the
   * moment the terminal intersects again, and the engine's damage is likewise visibility-scoped
   * rather than visibility-dropped — the repacked rows are uploaded on the frame that brings the
   * grid back. Note the timing, because it widens the "one frame" above: the observer lifts the
   * pause ASYNCHRONOUSLY and the refresh it schedules is debounced, so a grid panned back into view
   * right after a reset can show stale glyphs for a FEW frames, not exactly one.
   *
   * Bounded by nothing here on purpose: a page too small for the canvas would reset again on the
   * repack, request another redraw, and settle into a repaint per frame. That is the LRU escalation
   * Phase 2 names, and it needs to be VISIBLE (the atlas logs `resetCount`) rather than smoothed
