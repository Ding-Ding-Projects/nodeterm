// Pure aggregation and ordering for the collapsed Agent HUD indicator.
//
// `buildIndicator` is the ONE definition of what the collapsed capsule shows, derived from the same
// row array the expanded panel draws. It lives here rather than beside the main-process HUD model
// because the renderer is the only side that draws it, and a renderer must never import src/main
// (process-model boundary) — a copy over there could only ever be dead code that drifts, which is
// exactly what happened: it never grew the `needsYou` dot this renderer has been drawing.
//
// The indicator is a normal left-to-right flex row. This helper returns a deterministic agent
// order with Claude last so the collapsed surface does not shuffle between updates.
//
// Kept pure + Electron-free so both are unit-tested without a DOM.
