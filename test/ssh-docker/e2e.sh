# Run askpass-e2e.test.ts against the harness sshd, with the ssh CLIENT inside a container.
#
# The suite refuses to run on the host (it drives a real `ssh`, and `ssh` reads the passwd
# database rather than $HOME, so StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new would append to the real
# ~/.ssh/known_hosts, which is banned here). This script gives it the only environment it accepts:
# a throwaway node container on the same docker network as the sshd container.
#
#   ./run.sh up && ./e2e.sh
#
# The container gets its own node_modules (an anonymous volume shadows the bind-mounted one, whose
# native builds are host-ABI-specific), installed with --ignore-scripts: nothing here needs node-pty or a
# real Electron binary. The test hardcodes 127.0.0.1:22022, which is the HOST's published port, so
# socat re-creates that address inside the container.
